# Computational plays

### Can statistics help interpret films, novels, poetry, plays, music and the like? 

I certainly hope so, becuase this is the aim of this project (For now the focus is on plays). While it is hard to quantitatively understand the nuances in works of fiction, the immense processing power that is available to us means that what we lack in depth of understanding we can try to make up for in breadth. Also by keeping to a strict methodological process, we can avoid perhaps the bane of literary analysis: picking and choosing what examples to illustrate our points. 


As the computationally analysis of literature is still in its infancy, the results produced by it will be simplistic. Yet hopefully, the process guarantees that the vague laws we do come up with do have some predictive power.
Even failing this-that which is highly probably in these early stages-by analyzing large volumes of data, certain trends might become apparent that will inform a closer reading of the text.

### The Bechdel Test

The most successful application of a metric to movies I believe is the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test). The tests asks whether "a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man." Despite this rather low bar, the amount of movies that have failed this test is surprising, and informative of the current gender disparities that exists in the film industry. This effect can be dismissed if looking at any certain movie - A male centric movie by itself does not imply institutional sexism - but the overall trend shows us the status of the medium as a whole; in this case, it can push it to become better, if only by creating an awareness of the problem in the first place.

### Focus of this project
The focus of most of the analysis is in the same vein as the Bechdel test but on plays. Gender disparity is not the exclusive focus of this project, however, literary and stylistic analysis will also be a touched upon.

Why where plays chosen as the medium of interest? When analysing plays, it is easy to get meta information from the text, such as which character speaks which dialogue, to whom he or she is speaking to and the scenes the different characters are in. As such compared to poems and prose, it is easier to computationally analyze plays.

Feel free to submit patches with ideas to IDEAS.md on what type of analysis to do and how to perform said analysis.
