# Computational plays

When analysing plays, it is easy to get meta information from the text, such as which character speaks which dialogue, to whom he or she is speaking to and the act scenes the different characters are in.
As such compared to poems and prose, it is easier to computationally analyze plays.

The focus of most of the analysis is on gender disparities in plays, but it is not the exclusive focus of this project. For example the difference between the vocabulary used by the aristocrats and commoners is also looked at.

This project was partly inspired by the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test)


Feel free to submit patches with ideas to IDEAS.md on what type of analysis to do and how to perform said analysis.
