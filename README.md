Computational plays

When analysing plays, it is easy to get meta information from the text, such as which character speaks which dialogue, to whom he or she is speaking to and the act scenes the different characters are in.
As such compared to poems and prose, it is easier to computationally perform analysis on plays.

The focus on most of the computational analysis is on looking at gender disparities, but it is not the exclusive focus of this project. For example the difference between the vocabulary used by the aristocrats and plebians is also looked at.

Feel free to submit patches with ideas to IDEAS.md on what type of analysis to do and how to perform said analysis.
